Cezanne
=======

Cezanne is intended to be a simple dynamic programming language that is easy to write interpreters
for. Currently the set of operations is small and most of the "smart" stuff happens in the compiler.
Right now the compiler is written in Python, but it will be written in Cezanne soon.
